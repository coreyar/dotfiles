# dotfiles

Now that I've installed vim plugins and setup a terminal multiplexer it seems time to create a more robust dotfiles repo.
Includes a script to symlink files from this repo

#### [.vimrc](./.vimrc)
Currently contains vim-template configs

#### [.pyprompt.py](./.pyprompt.py)
Python interpreter customizations.

#### [.zshrc](./.zshrc)
Setups up zsh and contains some termainal customizations such as displaying git branch and terraform workspace

#### [.zprofile](./.zprofile)
Most sets up paths for the technologies I use frequently. Also contains some aliased commands
